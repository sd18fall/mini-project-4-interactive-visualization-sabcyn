# Interactive Visualization: Finding Your Ideal Dog
### By: Sabrina Pereira and Cynthia Yong

The purpose of the project is to create an interactive program that takes user input and generates a response. Therefore, we created a program that would help potential dog owners find their ideal dog breed. The user will need to answer 3 questions related to their dog preferences to yield an end result.

## To Get Started:
There are 2 libraries that are needed for this project:

1. Pygame: originally designed for writing video games, but we need it for program visualization and interaction
```
pip install pygame
```

2. Inquirer: used to ease the process of asking user questions and validating answers
```
pip install inquirer
```

## Running the Program
Code to run the program:

```
python3 Ideal_Dog_Quiz.py
```

## License

This project falls under the MIT Open Source License and any other relevant license

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Peter Seger for his patience and willingness to provide feedback and input on the program.

Shoutout to Youtube Channel: Tech with Tim for teaching us how to create buttons in pygame!
